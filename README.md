== Installation Instructions ==========
Applications used for the python_api_challenge:
- Jupyter Notebook
- GitBash terminal
- Visual Studio Code for the Readme.md
- Git Hub (to save versions and share code while in development)
- Image viewer such as Microsoft Photos or Microsoft Paint

Similar applications may also work.


== Operating Instructions =============
Open either the WeatherPy or VacationPy file in Jupyter Notebook.
Review Analysis at the top of the notebook.
Play/run all rows in order from top to bottom to review code output and data analysis.

ATTENTION: IF you want to run this script, register to the API resources listed below and name the file api_key.py in the either the WeatherPy or VacationPy folder.
